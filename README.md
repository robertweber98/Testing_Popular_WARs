# Testing_Popular_WARs
An inferential test of the predictive ability of the three most popular position-player WARs; fangraphs.com, baseball-reference.com, and baseball prospectus. 

## Data
For this, I used the 2017 fangraphs.com batting leaders table for all players with a plate appearance limit of 0, the full baseball-reference.com 2017 batting data set, and the full 2017 baseball prospectus batting data set. To comply with the websites' terms of use and service, the data is not included here.
