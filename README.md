# Testing_Popular_WARs
This project is an inferential test, using a ridge-regression, of the predictive ability of the three most popular position-player WARs; fangraphs.com, baseball-reference.com, and baseball prospectus. 
### The conclusion being that none of them are reasonably better at predicting a team's wins than any other.

## Data
For this, I used the 2017 fangraphs.com batting leaders table for all players with a plate appearance limit of 0, the full baseball-reference.com 2017 batting data set, and the full 2017 baseball prospectus batting data set. To comply with the websites' terms of use and service, the data is not included here.
